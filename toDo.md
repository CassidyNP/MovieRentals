# Movie Rentals - Homework 2

## Things to do:
### In Movie class
* [ ] add 3 different subclasses [Regular, Children, New Release] <-- each of these sub classes will compute its own rental prices
* [ ] create getFrequentRentalPoints() method from the code in Rental class
### In Customer class
* [ ] create a method called updateFrequentRentalPoints() where you update and call the function getFrequentRentalPoints() from the Movie class
* [ ] The footer lines can be their very own method in Rental Class
* [ ] Instead of using the vector data structure lest use something easier to deal with

### What each class should have:
| Customer | Rental | Movie |
| -------- | -------- |-------- |
| updateFrequentRentalPoints() | getFrequentRentalPoints() | |
|  |  | |
